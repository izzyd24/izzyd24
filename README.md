# Overview: 
# Intro:
Hello! 
I am Izzy Diaz, I work full-time in the technology sector as an Empolyee Experience Analyst. 
Recently, you will notice a lack of pushed commits---Most of my work done on machine learning and quick visualizations are done internally for privacy concerns. 
However, happy to connect in a more formal setting to provide a better overview of recent projects. 

## About me/Contact: 
Feel free to request a moment to chat at izzy.diaz248@gmail.com OR give me a quick phone call at: 408-836-3800. I am interested in working the machine learning space but am most focused on a path towards Jr. Data Scientist/Data Analyst roles to work on my python skills as it relates to cleaning and then reporting out with visual tools (Tableau). 

## Recent Projects (Subject to External Privacy Limitations): 
Although I do not push many commits here, I would like to highlight two projects: 

### Paid Social Media: 
Internal project that leverages historical social media data from past two fiscal years, deploying a binary classification model (random forest) to identify the importance of each column to predict on our click-through rates per post. Early results confirm our ability to forecast when to post content and which content types to release by platform.
#### Benefits: 
Ideally, with the column weights identified, we would then hold our bi-weekly strategy meetings to leverage our budget for social media paid campaigns. Here we hope to leverage the results we have seen from our binary classification model to steer us clear of any content types, tone, or imagery that will perform worse in terms of engagement rate or click-through rates.

### HR Predictive Report: 
Leveraging a monthly candidate report with the Workday API to capture all application “starts” from sources such as Glassdoor. Cleaning all data via Py Juypter, and then utilizing Tableau to filter by hiring manager, gender, race/ethnicity to uncover trends in our workforce against turnover data internally. 
#### Benefits: 
We want to get to the point where teams in HR can cross-collaborate on their key metrics such as turnover and focus on early-career hiring towards a predictive model. More to come on this...
